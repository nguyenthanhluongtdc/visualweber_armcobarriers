                        <p>The Ministry of Industry and Trade has imposed a temporary anti-dumping tariff 
                        of 10.2 percent on H-shaped steel beams imported from Malaysia. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="according">
                        <p>
                        According to the General Department of Vietnam Customs, the import of the product
                        from Malaysia almost quadrupled from 17,000 tons in 2019 to nearly 65,000 tons last
                        year. The decision followed eight months of investigation from August 2020.</p>
                        <p>
                        The Trade Remedies Authority of Vietnam concluded that this surge in import of H-shaped
                        steel beams from Malaysia has severely affected domestic producers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        It said the temporary tariff would be in place until the investigation is complete, possibly
                        by the end of the second quarter this year.</p>

                        <p>Pakistan has initiated an anti-dumping investigation on cold-rolled steel 
                        products from Vietnam with a proposed duty of 27.98 percent.</p>
                        <p>Its trade authorities have asked China Steel and Nippon Steel Vietnam, based in
                        the southern province of Ba Ria–Vung Tau, to provide feedback to dumping allegations
                        within 45 days starting February 25.</p>
                        <p>The alleged dumping of these products has hurt local producers, according to the 
                        Pakistan National Tariffs Commission.</p>
                        <p>Pakistan will issue a preliminary determination at the end of April.</p>
                        <p>Other markets that face similar allegations are China, the E.U. and South Korea.</p>
                        <p>In January, Malaysia revised duties on cold-rolled coils of alloy and non-alloy steel 
                        from Vietnam to 7.42-33.7 percent for the period between January 24 and May 23.</p>
